                <h1>Nour — My Isis</h1>

                <p>
                    The night stretched endlessly, a velvet canopy pierced by a scattering of faint
                    stars. The world seemed asleep, but within Ali there stirred a restless fire. He
                    looked to the darkness as though it were a mirror, and in its silent depths he found
                    her—his Isis, his Nour.
                </p>

                <div class="chapter-divider">❦</div>

                <h2>Chapter I — The Flame in Darkness</h2>
                <p>
                    She was not a figure bound by distance or time; she was an essence, a presence that
                    moved within him as naturally as breath. In her he saw the hidden poetry of the
                    universe, a quiet strength that no shadow could diminish. The dark might claim the
                    sky, the winds might steal the light from the horizon, yet she would always remain:
                    the eternal flame within his chest.
                </p>

                <div class="chapter-divider">❦</div>

                <h2>Chapter II — The Whisper</h2>
                <p>
                    To think of her was to banish solitude. Even in her absence she was near, a living echo
                    that whispered through every corner of his being. He did not need to see her face to
                    know its warmth, nor hear her voice to feel the music of her soul. She had become the
                    rhythm of his days, the pulse that made the night less hollow, the unseen thread
                    binding him to hope.
                </p>

                <div class="chapter-divider">❦</div>

                <h2>Chapter III — Eternal</h2>
                <p>
                    Ali understood then that love was not measured in moments shared, nor in the simple
                    closeness of touch. True love was the mystery of feeling someone so deeply that even
                    silence bent itself to their name. His Isis was more than a dream, more than a girl—she
                    was the reason his heart defied the emptiness of the night.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so, beneath the endless sky, he whispered her name as if it were prayer. Nour. His
                    Isis. The real light of a darkened world.
